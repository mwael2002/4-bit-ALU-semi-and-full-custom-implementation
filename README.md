# 4-bit ALU semi and full custom implementation
Design of ALU can execute arithmetic and logical operations. It can preform 8 Arithmetic and 8 logical operations The output (arithmetic or
logical) is selected by the MSB of the selection line, while the required operation is selected by
the other 3 bits. There's flip-flops at the inputs and outputs of the ALU.

## Tool Used
he Cadence® Virtuoso® System Design Platform is a holistic, system-based solution that provides the functionality to drive simulation and LVS-clean layout of ICs and packages from a single schematic (https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/custom-ic-analog-rf-design/layout-design/virtuoso-layout-suite.html).
