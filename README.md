# 4-bit ALU semi and full custom implementation

from May 2023 - Jun 2023

Associated with Faculty Of Engineering Ain Shams University

## Project Description:

Design of ALU can execute arithmetic and logical operations. It can preform 8 Arithmetic and 8 logical operations The output (arithmetic or
logical) is selected by the MSB of the selection line, while the required operation is selected by
the other 3 bits. There's flip-flops at the inputs and outputs of the ALU.

## Tool Used
he Cadence® Virtuoso® System Design Platform is a holistic, system-based solution that provides the functionality to drive simulation and LVS-clean layout of ICs and packages from a single schematic (https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/custom-ic-analog-rf-design/layout-design/virtuoso-layout-suite.html).

Verilog, standardized as IEEE 1364, is a hardware description language (HDL) used to model electronic systems. It is most commonly used in the design and verification of digital circuits at the register-transfer level of abstraction.[citation needed] It is also used in the verification of analog circuits and mixed-signal circuits, as well as in the design of genetic circuits.[1] In 2009, the Verilog standard (IEEE 1364-2005) was merged into the SystemVerilog standard, creating IEEE Standard 1800-2009. Since then, Verilog is officially part of the SystemVerilog language. The current version is IEEE standard 1800-2017
